# Deployment options

Docker Compose is the recommended deployment path and has been validated
end-to-end in a real fresh-install environment. The physical-machine and
service-manager paths are advanced references for operators who need them.

## Docker Compose (recommended)

Four containers (frontend, backend, MySQL, and Redis) start with one command.
This is the path described in [Getting started](/guide/getting-started).

For a new installation, run the version-pinned launcher from the stable
GitHub Release:

```bash
set -o pipefail
curl -fsSL \
  https://github.com/OrangeServers/OrangeServer/releases/download/v1.0.2/bootstrap-compose.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --version v1.0.2
```

The launcher downloads and verifies the matching deployment bundle, generates
the MySQL and Redis infrastructure passwords, and starts the published
`ghcr.io/orangeservers/orangeserver-backend:v1.0.2` image. Application
settings—including the administrator, SMTP, and AI providers—remain in the
browser-based `/setup` wizard. Review the launcher first if your environment
does not permit piping downloaded scripts to a shell.

For mainland China, use the first published `vX.Y.Z` release that includes the
fixed-tag Gitee launcher:

```bash
set -o pipefail
curl -fsSL https://gitee.com/orangeservers/OrangeServer/raw/vX.Y.Z/ops/bootstrap-compose-cn.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --version vX.Y.Z
```

This route uses the Tencent Cloud TCR backend image and digest-pinned DaoCloud
public mirrors for Nginx, Redis, and MySQL. DaoCloud has no availability SLA;
the three full dependency image references are operator-overridable.

For a source checkout or an existing installation, use the repository targets:

```bash
make docker-up        # bundled mode: everything in containers
make docker-up-host   # host mode: reuse an existing MySQL/Redis on the host
```

## Physical machine

Install MySQL, Redis, nginx, and the Python backend directly on the host. This
advanced reference path has a preflight script for the environment before first
start:

```bash
ops/preflight-physical-backend.sh
```

## systemd / supervisor

Run the backend under systemd or supervisor with the same gunicorn command the
containers use. This is an advanced reference path; unit files and configuration
layouts are documented in the deployment manual.

## Reference

The full manual — both one-line routes, environment variables, nginx
configuration, health checks, and troubleshooting — lives in

[upgrade procedure](https://github.com/OrangeServers/OrangeServer/blob/main/docs/operations/UPGRADE.md).
