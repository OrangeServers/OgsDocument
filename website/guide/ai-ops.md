# AI operations

OrangeServer's AI assistant works inside the same permission boundary as every
human user — it queries authorized platform data, runs fixed read-only
diagnostics, and prepares batch actions that always require human approval.

## What it can do

- **Query platform data** through permission-filtered structured tools: assets,
  groups, execution logs, audit records. Results come back as server-side
  result sets with authoritative IDs.
- **Run read-only diagnostics** on managed hosts using fixed server-owned
  Linux/Docker profiles. Evidence is sanitized, size-capped, encrypted at
  rest, and every finding must cite evidence from the current run.
- **Prepare batch commands** across authorized assets. The plan is shown as an
  approval card; nothing executes until a human approves it.
- **Answer in your language** — replies follow the interface language setting.

## What it cannot do

- It cannot run SQL or open a shell.
- It cannot execute anything that has not been explicitly approved.
- It cannot invent asset IDs, database fields, or execution results — tool
  results are the only source of truth.
- Tool output, history summaries, and diagnostic evidence are treated as
  untrusted low-privilege data: instructions embedded in them are never
  followed.

## Evidence and audit

Every tool call, approval, and execution is recorded. Diagnostic findings are
deterministic and citable — each one references evidence IDs from the current
diagnostic run, so conclusions can always be traced back to raw data.
