# Changelog

Notable user-visible changes are recorded here. This project follows the
principles of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Added

- AI autonomy M1/S1 safety and approval baseline (disabled by default):
  Run/Step/event/artifact domain model with a strict server-side state
  machine, an administrator-managed asset environment column
  (`t_host.ai_environment`, rev53), structured probe actions with budget,
  policy, redaction, and approval-digest validation, and optimistic-revision
  step decisions that re-check asset and credential authorization atomically.
  Every autonomy endpoint stays rejected until `OGS_AI_AUTONOMY_ENABLED` is
  explicitly set, and this stage performs no remote execution.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Dashboard asset, user, and group totals now exclude soft-deleted records, so
  the overview cards and resource distribution chart stay consistent with the
  corresponding management lists after records are deleted.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- China mainland one-line Compose deployment through a fixed Gitee release tag,
  the project backend on Tencent Cloud TCR, and digest-pinned DaoCloud public
  mirrors for the official Nginx, Redis, and MySQL images. All public dependency
  image references remain operator-overridable.

- Full bilingual UI (Simplified Chinese / English): every page, menu,
  dialog, and Element Plus built-in string follows the interface language.
  Switch instantly under Settings → Appearance & Language; the choice is
  persisted in `t_settings.language` (rev51 migration) and applied on the
  login page before sign-in. The AI assistant answers in the configured
  language, and a `check-i18n` build gate keeps the two locales in key
  parity with no hard-coded UI strings.

- First-run web setup wizard (`/setup`): when required configuration (MySQL,
  secret key, Fernet keys) is missing, the backend boots into a minimal
  wizard app instead of failing. The wizard validates connectivity, creates
  the schema and an administrator account (replacing the seeded weak
  `admin/admin` row), writes configuration to `<data dir>/runtime.env`
  (0600), and restarts the worker automatically. Guarded by a one-time
  setup token, origin checks, and a completion sentinel; `OGS_SETUP_MODE`
  supports `off`/`force`. Broken configurations on an already-configured
  system now land in a read-only maintenance page instead of a crash loop.

- Dashboard "AI operations executions" panel: a 7-day stacked success/failure
  bar chart backed by the new `GET /ai/stats` endpoint, which aggregates
  existing `t_command_log` rows of type `AI 批量命令` (no schema change).

- Web AI operations assistant with permission-filtered platform tools,
  server-side result sets, visible tool events, conversation history, and
  approval-gated batch commands.
- OpenAI-compatible Provider presets, encrypted API Key storage, model
  discovery, Tool Calling verification, and explicit enable/default controls.
- 256K standard context mode and an opt-in 1M deep-diagnostic context mode for
  Providers whose capability is explicitly declared by an administrator.
- Server-owned read-only Linux and Docker diagnostic profiles, encrypted
  evidence, deterministic cited findings, Runbook guidance, per-asset progress,
  and owner-scoped diagnostic APIs.
- Public documentation center, AI user/configuration/API guides, unified
  upgrade procedure, trust-boundary documentation, and community health files.

### Fixed

- The versioned installer now normalizes only the packaged frontend static
  assets to Nginx-readable permissions, preventing `/setup` from returning 500
  after a restrictive fixed-tag checkout while keeping generated secrets 0600.

- Every documented deployment path now actually works, verified end-to-end
  (deployment audit): `orange.sql` is loadable for the first time — seed
  INSERTs use explicit column lists, FK target columns got the required
  indexes, and FK column charsets are aligned (verified against a real
  `mysql:8.0` initdb, now guarded by a CI job). Physical-machine preflight no
  longer fails on its own bugs (literal `'***'` passwords, nonexistent
  `Config` class); install scripts fix a long-standing bash syntax error,
  actually create the `app_user` database account, and no longer write the
  root password into the backend env. Compose host mode gets a working
  `make docker-up-host`; `make docker-up` is re-entrant; the physical nginx
  config now serves the frontend SPA; systemd/supervisor instructions and
  path layouts are consistent; `CHANGE_ME` placeholders are rejected at
  startup; MySQL 8 `caching_sha2_password` verified working out of the box.

### Changed

- AI operations page redesign: model and context-mode selectors moved into the
  composer toolbar, assistant replies render Markdown (tables, lists, code),
  approval cards use a horizontal status strip, the context sidebar only shows
  sections that have data, and switching model/context asks before starting a
  new conversation.
- Batch operation canvas colors now map to the global theme tokens so the
  batch command/script pages render correctly in the dark theme.
- Page containers are full-width (the previous 1600px cap is removed); the
  dashboard AI card reuses the sidebar `Cpu` icon for consistency.
- Batch command and script pages now use a three-stage operation canvas with
  real asset and credential data, an explicit local configuration check,
  authoritative per-asset results, and retry for failed assets.
- Batch execution remains synchronous and no longer presents simulated
  per-host progress before the server returns a final response.
- Batch scripts accept UTF-8 `.sh` and `.py` files up to 1 MB and use fixed
  `bash` or `python3` interpreters; legacy response fields remain available
  alongside structured per-asset `items[]`.
- The legacy `put_type=send` mode remains upload-only and compatible; the new
  batch script page uses the separately validated `put_type=sh` path.
- Tool running and completed states render as one timeline record.
- Batch execution results remain available in the conversation and distinguish
  success, partial failure, failure, rejection, cancellation, and expiry.
- Follow-up messages use the latest authoritative action state instead of the
  stale pending snapshot from action creation.
- Dashboard AI status uses the same numeric card structure as other summary
  metrics.
- Public project licensing is consistently documented as Apache-2.0.

### Security

- Batch commands and scripts revalidate asset access, credential use,
  asset-credential authorization, soft-deletion state, duplicate and empty
  targets, a 50-host limit, and dangerous input before any remote operation.
- Provider API Keys are encrypted server-side and never returned by the API.
- Provider destinations reject private, loopback, and link-local addresses
  unless the administrator explicitly enables a controlled private gateway.
- AI execution revalidates owner, conversation, expiry, asset authorization,
  system-user authorization, target limits, and dangerous-command rules.

### Upgrade notes

- Existing installations enabling AI must apply `rev48_ai_provider.sql`,
  `rev49_ai_context_window.sql`, and `rev50_ai_diagnostics.sql` in order.
- Follow [the unified upgrade procedure](docs/operations/UPGRADE.md); do not
  execute isolated migration snippets from older documentation.
